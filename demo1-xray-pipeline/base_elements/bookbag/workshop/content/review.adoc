== Review

Normally you should have learned a few things in this Lab:

* Create Ceph buckets
* Create bucket notifications
* Deploy and use Kafka
* Deploy and use Serverless functions
* ...

But more importantly, you have seen how you can connect all those components together to create a data pipeline. This example is applied to healthcare, and uses an AI/ML model, but the underlying architecture can be applied anywhere, in a lot of situations.

If you want to have a look at the code running inside the different containers, head out to https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/jumpstart-library/tree/main/pattern1-xray-pipeline/base_elements/containers[this repo].

And if you have further questions, please contact me: gmoutier@redhat.com

Thank you!
