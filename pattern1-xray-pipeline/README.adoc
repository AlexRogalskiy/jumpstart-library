== Pattern 1 - XRay analysis automated pipeline

// tag::description[]

In this pattern, we show how to implement an automated data pipeline for chest Xray analysis:

* Ingest chest Xrays into an object store based on Ceph.
* The Object store sends notifications to a Kafka topic.
* A KNative Eventing Listener to the topic triggers a KNative Serving function.
* An ML-trained model running in a container makes a risk of Pneumonia assessment for incoming images.
* A Grafana dashboard displays the pipeline in real time, along with images incoming, processed and anonymized, as well as full metrics.
