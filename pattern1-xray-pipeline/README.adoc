== Pattern 1 - XRay analysis automated pipeline

In this pattern, we implement an automated data pipeline for chest Xray analysis:

* Ingest chest Xrays into an object store based on Ceph.
* The Object store sends notifications to a Kafka topic.
* A KNative Eventing Listener to the topic triggers a KNative Serving function.
* An ML-trained model running in a container makes a risk of Pneumonia assessment for incoming images.
* A Grafana dashboard displays the pipeline in real time, along with images incoming, processed and anonymized, as well as full metrics.

This pipeline is showcased link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zja83FVsm14[in this video] (slides are also link:docs/Commons_Data_Science_Pipelines.pdf[here]).

=== Content

In this folder you will find the following content for this pattern:

* link:base_elements[*base_elements*]: notebooks, container images, scripts, images,... that are used to build the demo or run it.
* link:manual_deployment[*manual_deployment*]: instructions to manually deploy the demo in an OpenShift environment, like creating configmaps, deployments,...
* link:automated_deployment[*automated_deployment*]: scripts and playbooks to deploy the base elements (operators) as well as a workshop environment based on bookbag to guide you through the rest of the deployment.
