In this folder you'll find:

* link:prerequisites[*prerequisites*]: steps you have to follow to install the base elements in your environment like operators. They were separated from the main deployment as you may already have them installed.
* link:deployment[*deployment*]: steps to follow to fully deploy the demo.
* link:tools[*tools*]: notebooks and scripts used to configure some elements or work with the demo. They are not required to deploy or run it.
