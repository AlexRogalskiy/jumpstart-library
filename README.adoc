== Jumpstart Library

This repo contains documentation, source code, workshop contents, HowTos... for different use cases (aka "patterns") of Data Science, Data Engineering, AI/ML, Analytics...

The goal is to provide users with concrete elements that they will be able to learn from, reproduce, adapt and modify to fit their own needs and requirements.

This library currently presents two patterns.

=== Pattern 1 - XRay analysis automated pipeline
