== Pattern 2 - Licence plates edge-to-core scenario

// tag::description[]

In this pattern, we show how to implement this scenario:

* Using a trained ML model, licence plates are recognized at toll location.
* Data (plate number, location, timestamp) is send from toll locations (edge) to the core using Kafka mirroring to handle communication issues and recovery.
* Incoming data is screened real-time to trigger alerts for wanted vehicles (Amber Alert).
* In another pipe, incoming data is enriched with other information coming from licence registry system: car model, color,...
* Data is aggregated and stored into object storage.
* Data analysis leveraging Presto and Superset is done against stored data.
